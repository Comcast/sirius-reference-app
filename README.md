Included here are a couple of examples of using Sirius in an application. Each contains a more detailed README, but
to describe them briefly:

- The [groovy](groovy) application is a one-page application that lets you interact with Sirius in a shell, either standalone or as part of a cluster.
- The [java](java) application is a slightly more complex example -- a REST-ish web interface for sirius. It's still
quite simple, but shows a little more of an expected project structure using Sirius.

See each example's README for more details.
